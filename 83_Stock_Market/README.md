### Stock Market

This program “plays” the stock market. You will be given $10,000 and may buy or sell stocks. Stock prices and trends are generated randomly; therefore, this model does not represent exactly what happens on the exchange. (Depending upon your point of view, you may feel this is quite a good representation!)

Every trading day, a table of stocks, their prices, and number of shares in your portfolio is printed. Following this, the initials of each stock are printed followed by a question mark. You indicate your transaction in number of shares — a positive number to buy, negative to sell, or 0 to do no trading. A brokerage fee of 1% is charges on all transactions (a bargain!). Note: Even if the value of a stock drops to zero, it may rebound again — then again, it may not.

This program was created by D. Pessel, L. Braun, and C. Losik of the Huntington Computer Project at SUNY, Stony Brook, N.Y.
