### Synonym

A synonym of a word is another word (in the English language) which has the same, or very nearly the same, meaning. This program tests your knowledge of synonyms of a few common words.

The computer chooses a word and asks you for a synonym. The computer then tells you whether you’re right or wrong. If you can’t think of a synonym, type “HELP” which causes a synonym to be printed.

You may put in words of your choice in the data statements. The number following DATA in Statement 500 is the total number of data statements. In each data statement, the first number is the number of words in that statement.

Can you think of a way to make this into a more general kind of CAI program for any subject?

Walt Koetke of Lexington High School, Massachusetts created this program.

#### Porting Notes

 - Each time the player asks for HELP, one of the synonyms is shown
   and discarded. There is no protection against the player using up
   all of the help.

 - The player can ask for HELP and then submit that answer. Is it
   meant to be a clue, or just giving a correct answer to the player?
