### Hi-Lo

This game is an adaptation of the game GUESS; however, instead of just guessing a number between 1 and 100, in this game you win dollars when you guess the number. The directions, in the words of the author, are as follows:
1. There is an amount of money, between one and one hundred dollars, in the “HI-LO” jackpot.
2. You will have six chances in which to guess the amount of money in the jackpot.
3. After each guess, the computer will tell whether the guess was too high or too low.
4. If the correct amount of money is not guessed after six chances, the computer will print the amount in the jackpot.
5. If the correct amount of money is guessed within the six chance limit, the computer will register this amount.
6. After each sequence of guesses, you have the choice of playing again or ending the program. If a new game is played, a new amount of money will constitute the jackpot.
7. If youwin more than once, then your earnings are totalled.

The author is Dean ALtman of Fort Worth, Texas.
