### Bounce

This program plots a bouncing ball. Most computer plots run along the paper in the terminal (top to bottom); however, this plot is drawn horizontally on the paper (left to right).

You may specify the initial velocity of the ball and the coefficient of elasticity of the ball (a superball is about 0.85 — other balls are much less). You also specify the time increment to be used in “strobing” the flight of the ball. In other words, it is as though the ball is thrown up in a darkened room and you flash a light at fixed time intervals and photograph the progress of the ball.

The program was originally written by Val Skalabrin while he was at DEC.
