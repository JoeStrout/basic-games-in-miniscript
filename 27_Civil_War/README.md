### Civil War

This simulation is based on 14 battles in the Civil War. Facts and figures are based on the actual occurrence. If you follow the same strategy used in the actual battle, the results will be the same. Generally, this is a good strategy since the generals in the Civil War were fairly good military strategists. However, you can frequently outperform the Civil War generals, particularly in cases where they did not have good enemy intelligence and consequently followed a poor course of action. Naturally, it helps to know your Civil War history, although the computer gives you the rudiments.

After each of the 14 battles, your casualties are compared to the actual casualties of the battle, and you are told whether you win or lose the battle.

You may play Civil War alone in which case the program simulates the Union general. Or two players may play in which case the computer becomes the moderator.

Civil War was written in 1968 by three Students in Lexington High School, Massachusetts: L. Cram, L. Goodie, and D. Hibbard. It was modified into a 2-player game by G. Paul and R. Hess of TIES, St. Paul, Minnesota.

#### Known Bugs

- At the end of a single-player game, the program reports strategies used by "THE SOUTH", but these are in fact strategies used by the North (the computer player) -- the South is always a human player.
