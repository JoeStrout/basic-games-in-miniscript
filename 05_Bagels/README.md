### Bagels

In this game, the computer picks a 3-digit secret number using the digits 0 to 9 and you attempt to guess what it is. You are allowed up to twenty guesses. No digit is repeated. After each guess the computer will give you clues about your guess as follows:

- PICO    One digit is correct, but in the wrong place
- FERMI    One digit is in the correct place
- BAGELS   No digit is correct

You will learn to draw inferences from the clues and, with practice, youâ€™ll learn to improve your score. There are several good strategies for playing Bagels. After you have found a good strategy, see if you can improve it. Or try a different strategy altogether to see if it is any better. While the program allows up to twenty guesses, if you use a good strategy it should not take more than eight guesses to get any number.

The original authors of this program are D. Resek and P. Rowe of the Lawrence Hall of Science, Berkeley, California.
