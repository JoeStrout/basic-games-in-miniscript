### Pizza

In this game, you take orders for pizzas from people living in Hyattsville. Armed with a map of the city, you must then tell your delivery boy the address where the pizza is to be delivered. If the pizza is delivered to the correct address, the customer phones you and thanks you; if not, you must give the driver the correct address until the pizza gets delivered.

Some interesting modifications suggest themselves for this program such as pizzas getting cold after two incorrect delivery attempts or taking three or more orders at a time and figuring out the shortest delivery route. Send us your modifications!

This program seems to have surfaced originally at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. The author is unknown.

#### Known Bugs

- The program does no validation of its input, and crashes if you enter coordinates outside the valid range.  (Ports may choose to improve on this, for example by repeating the prompt until valid coordinates are given.)
