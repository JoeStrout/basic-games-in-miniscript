### One Check

In this game or puzzle, 48 checkers are placed on the two outside spaces of a standard 64-square checkerboard as shown:

|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| ● | ● |   |   |   |   | ● | ● |
| ● | ● |   |   |   |   | ● | ● |

| ● | ● |   |   |   |   | ● | ● |
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |
| ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● | ● |

The object is to remove as many checkers as possible by diagonal jumps (as in standard checkers).

It is easy to remove 30 to 39 checkers, a challenge to remove 40 to 44, and a substantial feat to remove 45 to 47.

The program was created and written by David Ahl.
