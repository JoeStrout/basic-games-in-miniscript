### Splat

SPLAT simulates a parachute jump in which you try to open your parachute at the last possible moment without going splat! You may select your own terminal velocity or let the computer do it for you. You many also select the acceleration due to gravity or, again, let the computer do it in which case you might wind up on any of eight planets (out to Neptune), the moon, or the sun.

The computer then tells you the height youâ€™re jumping from and asks for the seconds of free fall. It then divides your free fall time into eight intervals and gives you progress reports on your way down. The computer also keeps track of all prior jumps in the array A and lets you know how you compared with previous successful jumps. If you want to recall information from previous runs, then you should store array A in a disk or take file and read it before each run.

John Yegge created this program while at the Oak Ridge Associated Universities.
