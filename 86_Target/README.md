### Target

In this program, you are firing a weapon from a spaceship in 3-dimensional space. Your ship, the Starship Enterprise, is located at the origin (0,0,0) of a set of x,y,z coordinates. You will be told the approximate location of the target in 3-dimensional rectangular coordinates, the approximate angular deviation from the x and z axes in both radians and degrees, and the approximate distance to the target.

Given this information, you then proceed to shoot at the target. A shot within 20 kilometers of the target destroys it. After each shot, you are given information as to the position of the explosion of your shot and a somewhat improved estimate of the location of the target. Fortunately, this is just practice and the target doesnâ€™t shoot back. After you have attained proficiency, you ought to be able to destroy a target in 3 or 4 shots. However, attaining proficiency might take a while!

The author is H. David Crockett of Fort Worth, Texas.
