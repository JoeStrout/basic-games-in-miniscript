### Gomoko

GOMOKO or GOMOKU is a traditional game of the Orient. It is played by two people on a board of intersecting lines (19 left-to-right lines, 19 top-to-bottom lines, 361 intersections in all). Players take turns. During his turn, a player may cover one intersection with a marker; (one player uses white markers; the other player uses black markers). The object of the game is to get five adjacent markers in a row, horizontally, vertically or along either diagonal.

Unfortunately, this program does not make the computer a very good player. It does not know when you are about to win or even who has won. But some of its moves may surprise you.

The original author of this program is Peter Sessions of Peopleâ€™s Computer Company.
