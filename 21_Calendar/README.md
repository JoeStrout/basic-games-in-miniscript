### Calendar

This program prints out a calendar for any year. You must specify the starting day of the week of the year:
- 0: Sunday
- -1: Monday
- -2: Tuesday
- -3: Wednesday
- -4: Thursday
- -5: Friday
- -6: Saturday

You can determine this by using the program WEEKDAY. You must also make two changes for leap years. The program listing describes the necessary changes. Running the program produces a nice 12-month calendar.

The program was written by Geoffrey Chase of the Abbey, Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

#### Porting Notes

- While many modern environments have time/date functions that would make this program both easier and more automatic, in these ports we are choosing to do without them, as in the original program.

- Some ports choose to ask the user the starting day of week, and whether it's a leap year, rather than force changes to the code to fit the desired year.
