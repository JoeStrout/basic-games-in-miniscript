### Buzzword

This program is an invaluable aid for preparing speeches and briefings about educational technology. This buzzword generator provides sets of three highly-acceptable words to work into your material. Your audience will never know that the phrases donâ€™t really mean much of anything because they sound so great! Full instructions for running are given in the program.

This version of Buzzword was written by David Ahl.
