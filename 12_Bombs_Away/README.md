### Bombs Away

In this program, you fly a World War II bomber for one of the four protagonists of the war. You then pick your target or the type of plane you are flying. Depending on your flying experience and the quality of enemy defenders, you then may accomplish your mission, get shot down, or make it back through enemy fire. In any case, you get a chance to fly again.

David Ahl modified the original program which was created by David Sherman while a student at Curtis Jr. High School, Sudbury, Massachusetts.

#### Known Bugs

- If you play as Japan and say it is not your first mission, it is impossible to complete your mission; the only possible outcomes are "you made it through" or "boom".  Moreover, the odds of each outcome depend on a variable (R) that is only set if you played a previous mission as a different side.  It's possible this is an intentional layer of complexity meant to encourage repeat play, but it's more likely just a logical error.
