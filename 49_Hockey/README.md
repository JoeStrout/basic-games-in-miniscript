### Hockey

This is a simulation of a ice hockey game. The computer, in this case, moderates and referees the pay between two human opponents. Of course, one person could play both sides.

The program asks for team names, player names, and even the name of the referee. Four types of shot are permitted and a shot may be aimed at one of four areas. You are also asked about passing. The game is very comprehensive with lots of action, face offs, blocks, passes, 4 on 2 situations, and so on. Unfortunately there are no penalties.

The original author is Robert Puopolo; modifications by Steve North of Creative Computing.

#### Known Bugs

- An apparent missing line 430 causes the code to fall through from the "FLIPS A WRISTSHOT" case directly to the "BACKHANDS ONE" case.
- The author consistently misspells the verb "lets" (writing it like the contraction "let's"), while having no trouble with "leads", "gets", "hits", etc.
