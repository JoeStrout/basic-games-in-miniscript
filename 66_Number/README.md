### Number

In contrast to other number guessing games where you keep guessing until you get the random number selected by the computer (GUESS, TRAP, STARS, etc.), in this game you only get one guess per play and you gain or lose points depending upon how close your guess is to the random number selected by the computer. You occasionally get a jackpot which will double your point count. You win when you get 500 points.

#### Porting Notes

Contrary to the description, the computer picks *five* random numbers per turn, not one.  You are not rewarded based on how close your guess is to one number, but rather to which of these five random numbers (if any) it happens to match exactly.
