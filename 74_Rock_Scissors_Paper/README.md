### Rock, Scissors, Paper

Remember the game of rock-scissors-paper. You and your opponent make a motion three times with your fists and then either show:
- a flat hand (paper)
- fist (rock)
- two fingers (scissors)

Depending upon what is shown, the game is a tie (both show the same) or one person wins. Paper wraps up rock, so it wins. Scissors cut paper, so they win. And rock breaks scissors, so it wins.

In this computerized version of rock-scissors-paper, you can play up to ten games vs. the computer.

Charles Lund wrote this game while at the American School in The Hague, Netherlands.
