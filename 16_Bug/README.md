### Bug

The object of this game is to finish your drawing of a bug before the computer finishes.

You and the computer roll a die alternately with each number standing for a part of the bug. You must add the parts in the right order; in other words, you cannot have a neck until you have a body, you cannot have a head until you have a neck, and so on. After each new part has been added, you have the option of seeing pictures of the two bugs.

If you elect to see all the pictures, this program has the ability of consuming well over six feet of terminal paper per run. We can only suggest recycling the paper by using the other side.

Brian Leibowitz wrote this program while in the 7th grade at Harrison Jr-Se High School in Harrison, New York.
