### Slalom

This game simulates a slalom run down a course with one to 25 gates. The user picks the number of gates and has some control over his speed down the course.

If you’re not a skier, here’s your golden opportunity to try it with minimal risk. If you are a skier, here’s something to do while your leg is in a cast.

SLALOM was written by J. Panek while a student at Dartmouth College.

#### Known Bugs

- In the original version, the data pointer doesn't reset after a race is completed. This causes subsequent races to error at some future point at line 540, `READ Q'.

- It also doesn't restore the data pointer after executing the MAX command to see the gate speeds, meaning that if you use this command, it effectively skips those gates, and the speeds shown are completely incorrect.
