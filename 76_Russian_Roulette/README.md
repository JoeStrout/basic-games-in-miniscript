### Russian Roulette

In this game, you are given by the computer a revolver loaded with one bullet and five empty chambers. You spin the chamber and pull the trigger by inputting a “1,” or, if you want to quit, input a “2.” You win if you play ten times and are still alive.

Tom Adametx wrote this program while a student at Curtis Jr. High School in Sudbury, Massachusetts.

⚠️ This game includes EXPLICT references to suicide, and should not be included in most distributions, especially considering the extreme simplicity of the program.
