### Name

NAME is a silly little ice-breaker to get a relationship going between a computer and a shy human. The sorting algorithm used is highly inefficient — as any reader of _Creative Computing_ will recognize, this is the worst possible sort for speed. But the program is good fun and that’s what counts here.

NAME was originally written by Geoffrey Chase of the Abbey, Portsmouth, Rhode Island.
