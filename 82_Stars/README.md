### Stars

In this game, the computer selects a random number from 1 to 100 (or any value you set). You try to guess the number and the computer gives you clues to tell you how close you’re getting. One star (\*) means you’re far away from the number; seven stars (\*\*\*\*\*\*\*) means you’re really close. You get 7 guesses.

On the surface this game is similar to GUESS; however, the guessing strategy is quite different. See if you can come up with one or more approaches to finding the mystery number.

Bob Albrecht of People’s Computer Company created this game.
