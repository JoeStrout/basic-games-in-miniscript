### War

This program plays the card game of War. In War, the card deck is shuffled, then two cards are dealt, one to each player. Players compare cards and the higher card (numerically) wins. In case of a tie, no one wins. The game ends when you have gone through the whole deck (52 cards, 26 games) or when you decide to quit.

The computer gives cards by suit and number, for example, S-7 is the 7 of spades.
