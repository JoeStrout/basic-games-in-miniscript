### Chomp

This program is an adaptation of a mathematical game originally described by Martin Gardner in the January 1973 issue of _Scientific American_. Up to a 9x9 grid is set up by you with the upper left square in a poison square. This grid is the cookie. Players alternately chomp away at the cookie from the lower right. To take a chomp, input a row and column number of one of the squares remaining on the cookie. All of the squares below and to the right of that square, including that square, disappear.

Any number of people can play — the computer is only the moderator; it is not a player. Two-person strategies are interesting to work out but strategies when three or more people are playing are the real challenge.

The computer version of the game was written by Peter Sessions of People’s Computer Company.
