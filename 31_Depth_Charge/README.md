### Depth Charge

In this program you are captain of the destroyer USS Computer. An enemy submarine has been causing trouble and your mission is to destroy it. You may select the seize of the “cube” of water you wish to search in. The computer then determines how many depth charges you get to destroy the submarine.

Each depth charge is exploded by you specifying a trio of numbers; the first two are the surface coordinates (X,Y), the third is the depth. After each depth charge, your sonar observer will tell you where the explosion was relative to the submarine.

Dana Noftle wrote this program while a student at Acton High School, Acton, Massachusetts.
