### Bullseye

In this game, up to 20 players throw darts at a target with 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-point zones. The objective is to get 200 points.

You have a choice of three methods of throwing:

| Throw | Description        | Probable Score            |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------|
| 1     | Fast overarm       | Bullseye or complete miss |
| 2     | Controlled overarm | 10, 20, or 30 points      |
| 3     | Underarm           | Anything                  |

You will find after playing a while that different players will swear by different strategies. However, considering the expected score per throw by always using throw 3:

| Score (S) | Probability (P) | S x P |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
|     40    |  1.00-.95 = .05 |   2   |
|     30    |  .95-.75 = .20  |   6   |
|     30    |  .75-.45 = .30  |   6   |
|     10    |  .45-.05 = .40  |   4   |
|     0     |  .05-.00 = .05  |   0   |

Expected score per throw = 18

Calculate the expected score for the other throws and you may be surprised!
