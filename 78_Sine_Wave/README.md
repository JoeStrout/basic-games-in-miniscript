### Sine Wave

Did you ever go to a computer show and see a bunch of CRT terminals just sitting there waiting forlornly for someone to give a demo on them. It was one of those moments when I was at DEC that I decided there should be a little bit of background activity. And why not plot with words instead of the usual X’s? Thus SINE WAVE was born and lives on in dozens of different versions. At least those CRTs don’t look so lifeless anymore.
