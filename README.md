# basic-games-in-miniscript
100 classic BASIC computer games, converted to [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) for use in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/)


This is a set of roughly 100 classic computer games and diversions written in the BASIC programming language.  These appeared originally in the book BASIC Computer Games, and collected by Jeff Atwood for this project.

These games have all been ported to the modern [MiniScript](https://miniscript.org) language, and set up to play in [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro/) with an easy menu interface.
