### 3-D Plot

3-D PLOT will plot the family of curves of any function. The function Z is plotted as “rising” out of the x-y plane with x and y inside a circle of radius 30. The resultant plot looks almost 3-dimensional.

You set the function you want plotted in line 5. As with any mathematical plot, some functions come out “prettier” than others.

The author of this amazingly clever program is Mark Bramhall of DEC.
