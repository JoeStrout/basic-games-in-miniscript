### Queen

This game is based on the permissible moves of the chess queen â€” i.e., along any vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. In this game, the queen can only move to the left, down, and diagonally down to the left.

The object of the game is to place the queen (one only) in the lower left-hand square (no. 158), by alternating moves between you and the computer. The one to place the queen there wins.

You go first and place the queen in any one of the squares on the top row or the right-hand column. That is your first move. The computer is beatable, but it takes some figuring. See if you can devise a winning strategy.
