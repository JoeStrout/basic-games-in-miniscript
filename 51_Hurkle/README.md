### Hurkle

Hurkle? A Hurkle is a happy beast and lives in another galaxy on a planet named Lirht that has three moons. Hurkle are favorite pets of the Gwik, the dominant race of Lihrt and … well, to find out more, read “The Hurkle is a Happy Beast,” a story in the book _A Way Home_ by Theodore Sturgeon.

In this program a shy hurkle is hiding on a 10 by 10 grid. Homebase is point 0,0 in the _Southwest_ corner. Your guess as to the gridpoint where the hurkle is hiding should be a pair of whole numbers, separated by a comma. After each try, the computer will tell you the approximate direction to go look for the Hurkle. You get five guesses to find him; you may change this number, although four guesses is actually enough.

This program was written by Bob Albrecht of People’s Computer Company.
