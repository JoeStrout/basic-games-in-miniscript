### Fur Trader

You are the leader of a French fur trading expedition in 1776 leaving the Ontario area to sell furs and get supplies for the next year. You have a choice of three forts at which you may trade. The cost of supplies and the amount you recieve for your furs will depend upon the fort you choose. You also specify what types of furs that you have to trade.

The game goes on and on until you elect to trade no longer.

Author of the program is Dan Bachor, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

#### Known Bugs

- The value of some furs are not changed from the previous fort when you select fort 2 or 3.  As a result, you will get a different value for your firs depending on whether you have previously visited a different fort.  (All fur values are set when you visit Fort 1.)
